This repository contains example Python code demonstrating a common error: division by zero. The `bug.py` file shows the erroneous code that throws a `ZeroDivisionError` when calculating the average of an empty list. The `bugSolution.py` file shows the corrected version that avoids the error by handling the edge case of an empty input list.
